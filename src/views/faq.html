            minimize their impact.

            Compliance Monitoring: Ensuring adherence to national and international regulations
            governing
            maritime operations, such as SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea),
            MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships),
            and ISM Code (International Safety Management Code).

            Quality Management: Implementing quality management systems to maintain high standards of
            operation,
            maintenance, and management of vessels and maritime infrastructure. This may involve

            for document control, training, audits, and continuous improvement.

            Emergency Preparedness: Developing and implementing plans and procedures to respond
            effectively
            to emergencies at sea, such as fires, collisions, oil spills, or medical emergencies.
            This includes crew training, drills, and coordination with relevant authorities and
            response organizations.

            Technical Support: Providing technical expertise and support to ensure the safe and
            efficient
            operation of maritime assets. This may involve engineering assessments, performance
            monitoring,
            troubleshooting, and maintenance planning.

            Overall, marine assurance plays a crucial role in safeguarding lives, protecting the
